# Fraction Calculation
The Fraction class is an object that holds information about a fraction (numerator and denominator). It will have several constructors and both private and public methods implementing the behavior of a fraction. The FractionCalculator class is a class that will allow the user to enter in fractions and operations, calculating and displaying the result. It will run until the user tells it to quit. When this program is complete, you wonâ€™t have to second guess your fraction arithmetic ever again!
